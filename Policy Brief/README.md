The dataset is a comprehensive compilation of credit card information encompassing
various card typesâ€”Blue, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. It includes detailed
demographics of cardholders, their spending behaviors, and utilization rates, and
distinguishes between attrited and current customers. The analysis focuses more on
understanding spending patterns across different card types, demographic segments,
and educational backgrounds.

**Executive Summary:** 

The analysis uncovers a captivating perspective of
cardholder behavior. Blue cards are the most
common, while Platinum cardholders, with lower
utilization rates and higher credit limits, represent a
lucrative niche. Worryingly, consumer acquisition
is declining across all quarters, necessitating a rapid
response. Another intriguing picture is painted by
education level, with college students and
graduates dominating transactions.

**Key Findings:**

Transaction count analysis 

Utilization variation among card types

Quarterly and yearly attrition figures

Count of current cardholders

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, there are varied spending patterns among different education levels and card types.
Blue cards cater to frequent but smaller transactions, while Platinum cards target
fewer, higher-value purchases.
Seasonal fluctuations in customer engagement, with Q2 consistently showing
lower engagement.
Opportunities exist in reevaluating marketing strategies for mid-quarters and
understanding the dynamics behind the low enthusiasm and subsequent decline.
